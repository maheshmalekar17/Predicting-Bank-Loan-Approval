# Predicting-Bank-Loan-Approval


The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a bank loan application will be approved or not. By analyzing historical loan data, the model will identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions and provide insights to improve the loan approval process.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting bank loan approval, leveraging data science techniques to derive actionable insights and enhance decision-making processes.
